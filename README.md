static Folder has file UsedCryto.txt where are all names of cryptos used.

adding new csv files is not implemented, so if we add new crypto in our base It should have NewCrypto_values.csv in static folder else it will return 0 values for new crypto 

adding new crypto does not need Restarting server in any case.
